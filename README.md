# UnityToolsProjects
I wanted to learn how to use Unity, so I followed along in some tutorials, and then worked on some of my own ideas as small projects.

SpriteProcessor - Allows you to import sprites with set settings, and import many at the same time.

TextEditWindow - This was my main project not based off of a tutorial, and creates a window in Unity that you can either edit an entire script in, or choose specific methods from a C# class and save the changed script.

CreateCharacterWizard - This is pretty much what it's name says: a window wizard that lets you create a new gameobject and set it's sprites and some other settings at the same time.

SelectAllOfTag - This just lets you select all of the gameobjects in a scene that have the searched for keyword as some part of their name, I modified it to ignore the case of the searched keyword.
